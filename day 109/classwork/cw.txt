variable vs macros:

difference between macro and variable is that when we declare variable space is given for variable,
but when using variable with macros it doesn't use memory because when we create it, it has set value




abt code itself:

for (i=0; i<lim-1 && (c=getchar()) !=EOF && c!='\n'; ++i)
The program reads characters until the line limit, EOF, or newline character is reached.

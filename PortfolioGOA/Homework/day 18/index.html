    <h1 class="header">Five Paintings That Prove Da Vinci Was a Genius</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="headerp">Walter Isaacson says that greatness comes more from creativity than from genius.
        His biographies have cataloged the lives of Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin,
        and Steve Jobs — men who found patterns among the many fields they studied. In 
        his latest work, Isaacson decided to document the life of Leonardo da Vinci, 
        “the ultimate embodiment of someone who combines the arts and the sciences.”</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 class="baptism">The Baptism of Christ (c. 1472-1475)</h2>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p class="baptismp">Leonardo was born out of wedlock. Had he been a legitimate child, he would have taken
        over his family’s notary business. His status also excluded him from a classical 
        school like other sons from the upper middle class. Instead, Leonardo became an 
        apprentice to Verrocchio, one of the finest artists in Florence. The Baptism of 
        Christ was a collaborative effort between the two men, with Leonardo painting the
        young angel holding Jesus’ robe. Isaacson noted that this angel is much more expressive 
        than the other figures in the painting. Leonardo also contributed the scientifically 
        accurate ripples of water that pool under Jesus’ feet.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="jerome">St. Jerome in the Wilderness (c. 1480)</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="images/stjerome.jpg" alt="St. Jerome" class="jeromeimg">
    <br>
    <p class="jeromep">At the beginning of his anatomy studies, Leonardo painted St. Jerome in the Wilderness.
        While the artist had not completed many dissections at the time, experts have noticed 
        that the painting displays detailed knowledge of the skeleton, muscles, and nerves. 
        Using state-of-the-art multispectral infrared technology, we have recently learned that
        Leonardo did not get the neck muscles right the first time — instead, he came back to 
        the painting two decades after he began in order to perfect it.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="supper">The Last Supper (c. 1495-1496)</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="images/lastsupper.jpg" alt="Last Supper" class="supperimg">
    <br>
    <p class="supperp">The Last Supper was a mural commissioned by Ludovico Sforza, duke of Milan, and housed in the
        refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie. The painting is a dramatic narrative.
        Unlike other Renaissance painters, Leonardo was disinterested in creating still life works.
        The expressions on each apostle’s face are meant to display the ripple effect of Jesus’ 
        announcement that one among them would betray him. The painting also shows evidence of 
        Leonardo’s past as a stage designer. The accelerated perspective of the lines makes the room 
        look deeper. And because Leonardo was acutely aware of the placement of a window in the refectory,
        he painted the wall on the right as if light window had filtered into the room during lunch time.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="monalisa">Mona Lisa (1503-1506)</h2>
    <br> 
    <img src="images/monalisa.jpg" alt="Mona Lisa" class="monalisaimg">
    <br>
    <p class="monalisap">Perhaps the most famous painting in the world, the Mona Lisa is a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, 
        the wife of a Florentine silk merchant. Leonardo’s notebooks show that he began drawing her 
        smile while dissecting a human face to learn how the muscles of the lips worked. “Had he not 
        done the science, I don’t think he would have had a feel for the patterns of nature,” Isaacson 
        said. While much has been written about Mona Lisa’s smile, it was Leonardo’s study of optics that
        allowed him to create this interactive work. Leonardo used his knowledge of the human retina to 
        paint a smile that changes depending on where one looks. If you stare directly at it, it disappears. 
        But if your eyes drift to her chin, cheek, or forehead, your peripheral vision picks up on the 
        shadows and colors of the painting, revealing a slight smile.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="mundi">Salvator Mundi (1506-1513)</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="images/salvatormundi.jpg" alt="Salvator Mundi" class="mundiimg">
    <br>
    <p class="mundip">Salvator Mundi recently made a splash in the art world when it was unveiled by Christie’s to be auctioned 
        next month at a starting price of $100 million. The painting is the only Leonardo work in private hands 
        and was authenticated very recently. Like his earlier works, Leonardo used the sfumato technique to create 
        softened lines around Jesus’ face and robes. The lines of his hands that appear closest to the viewer are 
        sharpest. The sale of the painting has also reignited the debate over why the robes behind the orb in Jesus’s 
        left hand are not distorted. Isaacson believes this was purposeful — Leonardo’s notebooks reveal his knowledge 
        of how glass would warp any object behind it. Isaacson’s favorite explanation is that Leonardo was indicating 
        that Christ is miraculous.</p>

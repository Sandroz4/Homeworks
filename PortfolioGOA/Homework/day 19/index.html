        <p><b>Cloud services:</b></p>
        <h5>Cloud services provide many ways for business team members to interact with the technology they need. 
            The cloud is an internet-connected platform that can store and access information and programs. Since 
            the cloud stores the information instead of holding it on a computer, team members can access and use 
            it whether at home or in the office. Some cloud services can even run operation systems remotely, 
            allowing team members to use internal business programs remotely without installing them on their computers.</h5>

        <p><b>Software development:</b></p>
        <h5>IT services can often include software development processes to create custom applications that fulfill 
            specific business needs. For example, a startup business may rely on its IT service team to create a 
            software application for organizing and maintaining venture capitalist records. In these cases, IT can 
            provide the services you need to develop personalized software and ensure the program's viability through 
            continuous testing, development and maintenance.</h5>
        <p><b>Hardware installations and maintenance:</b></p>
        <h5>Many business IT services also include hardware installations, maintenance and repairs. For instance,
             a corporate IT department is often responsible for installing the computers, hard drives, printers,
              modems and routers that the company needs to operate. IT teams also evaluate a business's processes
               to determine the types of hardware that support its needs. In many businesses, technical teams are 
               also responsible for maintaining hardware and updating computers, modems or routers to support productivity
                and performance.</h5>

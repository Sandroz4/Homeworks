If the return type of the `main` function is compatible with `int`, returning from 
the initial call to `main` is equivalent to invoking the `exit` function with the value 
returned by `main` as the argument. When the terminating `}` of the `main` function is 
reached, a return value of 0 is assumed. If the return type is not compatible with `int`, 
the behavior is undefined.

The `fprintf` function writes output to the specified stream, controlled by the format string. 
The format string dictates how subsequent arguments are converted for output. If there are fewer 
arguments than required by the format, the behavior is undefined. If there are extra arguments 
after the format string is fully processed, they are evaluated but ignored. `fprintf` returns once 
it reaches the end of the format string.

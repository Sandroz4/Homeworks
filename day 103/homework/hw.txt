In this example, a stack overflow occurs when the recursive sum function is used to
 calculate the total of integers from 1 to a specified number. Each recursive call 
 llocates stack memory, and when the input number is excessively large (e.g., 1,000,000),
  the recursion depth grows beyond the stack's capacity. This eventually exhausts the
   available stack memory, causing the program to crash.
